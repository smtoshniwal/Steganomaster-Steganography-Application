# StegaNo---Steganography-Application
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. Hence, steganography is being used in lots of security communication systems. StegaNo is one of the examples which is implemented using steganography and encryption techniques.
